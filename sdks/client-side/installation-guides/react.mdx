With Dub Analytics, you can track leads and sales conversions on your website, enabling you to measure the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns.

## Quickstart

This quick start guide will show you how to get started with Dub Analytics on your website.

<InstallDubAnalytics />

## Concepts

You can pass the following props to the `<Analytics />` component to customize the tracking script:

<ParamField body="cookieOptions" type="CookieOption Object">
  <Expandable title="properties">
    <ParamField body="domain" type="string">
      Specifies the value for the `Domain` Set-Cookie attribute. This is useful
      for cross-domain tracking. Example: `.example.com`
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="expires" type="integer" default="90">
      Specifies the `Date` object to be the value for the `Expires` Set-Cookie
      attribute. Example: `new Date('2024-12-31')`
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="expiresInDays" type="integer" default="90">
      Specifies the number (in days) to be the value for the `Expires`
      Set-Cookie attribute. Example: `90`
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="path" type="string" default="/">
      Specifies the value for the `Path` Set-Cookie attribute. By default, the
      path is considered the "default path". Example: `/`
    </ParamField>
  </Expandable>
</ParamField>

<ParamField
  body="attributionModel"
  type="first-click | last-click"
  default="last-click"
>
  The attribution model to use for the analytics event. The following
  attribution models are available:

- `first-click`: The first click model
  gives all the credit to the first touchpoint in the customer journey.
- `last-click`: The last click model gives all the credit to the last
  touchpoint in the customer journey.

</ParamField>

For example, to set a cross domain cookie that works on the apex domain (`domain.com`) as well as subdomains (`app.domain.com`):

```jsx app/layout.tsx
import { Analytics as DubAnalytics } from "@dub/analytics";

<DubAnalytics
  cookieOptions={{
    domain: process.env.IS_PRODUCTION_ENV
      ? ".yourdomain.com" // for cross-domain tracking
      : undefined,
  }}
/>;
```

Alternatively, to set a first-click attribution model:

```jsx app/layout.tsx
import { Analytics as DubAnalytics } from "@dub/analytics";

<DubAnalytics attributionModel="first-click" />;
```
