## View your conversions

Once you've set this up, all your tracked lead events will show up on your [Analytics dashboard](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-analytics). We provide 3 different views to help you understand your conversions:

- **Time-series**: A [time-series view](https://dub.co/help/article/dub-analytics#1-time-series-analytics-chart) of the number of leads over time.
- **Funnel chart**: A funnel chart view visualizing the conversion & dropoff rates across the different steps in the conversion funnel (clicks → leads → sales).
- **Real-time events stream**: A [real-time events stream](https://dub.co/help/article/real-time-events-stream) of every single lead event that occurs across all your links in your workspace.
