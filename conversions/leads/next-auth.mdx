In this guide, we will be focusing on tracking new user sign-ups for a SaaS application that uses NextAuth.js for user authentication.

## Configure NextAuth.js Options

Then, set up your NextAuth.js configuration options to track a lead conversion event using the `dub` TypeScript SDK.

Here's how it works in a nutshell:

1. Use NextAuth's [`signIn` event](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/events#signin) to detect when there's a new sign up.
2. If the user is a new sign up, check if the `dclid` cookie is present.
3. If the `dclid` cookie is present, send a lead event to Dub using `dub.track.lead`
4. Delete the `dclid` cookie.

Under the hood, Dub records the user as a customer and associates them with the click event that they came from. The user's unique ID is now the source of truth for all future events – hence why we don't need the `dclid` cookie anymore.

```typescript App Router
// app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/options.ts
import type { NextAuthOptions } from "next-auth";
import { cookies } from "next/headers";
import { dub } from "@/lib/dub";

export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
  ...otherAuthOptions, // your other NextAuth options
  events: {
    async signIn(message) {
      // if it's a new sign up
      if (message.isNewUser) {
        // check if dclid cookie is present
        const dclid = cookies().get("dclid")?.value;
        if (dclid) {
          // send lead event to Dub
          await dub.track.lead({
            clickId: dclid,
            eventName: "Sign Up",
            customerId: user.id,
            customerName: user.name,
            customerEmail: user.email,
            customerAvatar: user.image,
          });
          // delete the dclid cookie
          cookies().set("dclid", "", {
            expires: new Date(0),
          });
        }
      }
    },
  },
};
```

```typescript Pages Router
// pages/api/auth/[...nextauth]/options.ts
import type { NextApiRequest } from "next";
import type { NextAuthOptions } from "next-auth";
import { dub } from "@/lib/dub";

export const getOptions = (req: NextApiRequest): NextAuthOptions => ({
  ...otherAuthOptions, // your other NextAuth options
  events: {
    async signIn(message) {
      // if it's a new sign up
      if (message.isNewUser) {
        // check if dclid cookie is present
        const { dclid } = req.cookies;
        if (dclid) {
          // send lead event to Dub
          await dub.track.lead({
            clickId: dclid,
            eventName: "Sign Up",
            customerId: user.id,
            customerName: user.name,
            customerEmail: user.email,
            customerAvatar: user.image,
          });
        }
      }
    },
  },
});
```

## Create a NextAuth.js Route Handler

Finally, import the `authOptions` variable you created earlier and use `NextAuth` to create a handler for your NextAuth.js routes.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript App Router
// app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/index.ts
import { authOptions } from "./options";
import NextAuth from "next-auth";

const handler = NextAuth(authOptions);

export { handler as GET, handler as POST };
```

```typescript Pages Router
// pages/api/auth/[...nextauth]/index.ts
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import { getOptions } from "./options";

const handler = (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) =>
  NextAuth(req, res, getOptions(req));

export default handler;
```
